## Snake-Game
### Description
This is a console game in which the user uses their keyboard to move the snake. \
The user will use their **up, down, left, and right** keys. \
The snake will be able to grow in length when it consumes a food block. 
Every time a "level up" occurs, the speed will **increase**. 

### Rules
1. Don't touch any of the walls. 
2. Don't let the head of the snake touch any other part of its body. 

**If it touches _any of the walls_ or its _own body_, the game is over.**  \
The goal is to **grow** as much as you can!
